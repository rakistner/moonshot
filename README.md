# USPTO Cancer Moonshot Challenge

### Relating Federal Funding to Research and Patent Filings

The ipython notebook in this repository titled 'Data Processing' will run using the cleaned `.csv` data files also in this repository. The full original data sets used in the cleaned data sets were too large to be included, and can be downloaded from their appropriate sources. To run the notebook, make sure you have python 3 installed, as well as jupyter and the plotly library. Clone the repository, cd into it and run `jupyter notebook` to start it up locally on your machine. Github will run the notebook in the browser for you to look at however. All the data in the final presentation came from this notebook. The final data set is located under `sets/final_dataset.tsv`.

This project highlights federal funding and grants that has resulted in patents, and clinical trials research patterns by grant recipient institutions. A major trend is the overall decrease in federal spenditure on cancer research. If you like this project, please consider donating to a cancer research institute, such as the Penn State Hershey Cancer Institute or the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, to help fund cancer research, and solve cancer.
